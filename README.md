# generics

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cneill/generics.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cneill/generics)

This package adds some cool functions that have been enabled by the addition of
[generics](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/43651-type-parameters.md)
to the language in [Go 1.18](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18).

This package may change drastically! Don't rely on it for your code (yet). This is mostly for testing purposes.
